# Menari-core: LLM Component Implementation

This repository is a sub-project of the main `Menari` LLM development initiative. It focuses on the foundational phase of implementing core Large Language Model (LLM) components from scratch.

## Objectives

-   **Tokenization:** Implement a basic tokenizer.
-   **Embedding Layer:** Create an embedding layer.
-   **Positional Encoding:** Implement positional encoding mechanisms.
-   **Attention Mechanism:** Implement a self-attention mechanism.
-   **Feed-Forward Networks:** Implement simple feed-forward neural networks.
-   **Layer Normalization & Residual Connections:** Implement these stability-enhancing components.

## Technologies Used

-   Python
-   NumPy

## Getting Started

More detailed instructions will be added as components are implemented.
